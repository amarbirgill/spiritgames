          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Mission Statement:</h2>
          <p class="lead">On April 25th, 2015 the 7.8M Gorkha earthquake struck the country of Nepal reaping havoc as the worst natural disaster the country has seen since 1934. With total damage costs of around $10 billion amounting to over 50% of Nepalâ€™s GDP a wholesome recovery from this terrible event is set to be a long and difficult process. Humanitarian aid has been dispatched to varying degrees throughout the affected regions yet with a disaster of such magnitude no amount is ever enough. 
          Wanting to help my country I have thought towards coming up with an effective manner for bringing in as many donations as possible from the whole world in this time of need. We are constantly growing more attached to our phones and the applications upon them. We are able to entertain ourselves anywhere on the go as the technology only grows more advanced. With this concept in mind my company, Spirit Games Ltd is creating a game, Kathmandu Dash, based around Nepal and the earthquake. We aim to combine the addictive factor of mobile gaming and inspire small in-game purchases while raising donations towards Nepal. If this game succeeds Spirit Games Ltd aims to create games aimed at aiding other countries struck by natural disasters. </p>
